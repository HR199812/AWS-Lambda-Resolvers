## Database Resolver for MongoDb in AWS Lambda

### Create a cluster in mongoDb Atlas:-
1. Now, either create a database and add some entries or generate the sample database.
2. Get the connection string to be used to connect to the database.

### So there are basically two ways to this approach:-
### 1. Using MongoClient without any VPC:-
1. Create a node js project and install mongoDb in it.
2. use the code inside index.js file to complete the setup.
### Using this approach is ok but it is not a secureed way to do the approach.

### 2. Using MongoClient with VPC and Security Groups:-
1. Create a node js project and install mongoDb in it.
2. use the code inside index.js file to complete the setup.
### Using this approach is ok but it is not a secureed way to do the approach.
